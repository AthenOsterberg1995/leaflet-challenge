# leaflet-challenge
bootcamp leaflet project

To view the map and earthquake markers, use the controls in the top right of the page.

This code borrowed from outside sources which are marked in the code as well.

I found the css and javascript code for my map's legend at:
https://codepen.io/haakseth/pen/KQbjdO

I found hex values for colors at:
https://rdrr.io/cran/leaflet/man/colorNumeric.html

The codes structure also borrowed from the bootcamp leaflet module class 3 activity 2 and class 1 activity 9
